# tree-sitter-qsharp

A [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) grammar for [Q#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/overview-what-is-qsharp-and-qdk), Microsoft's quantum programming language.

This is a new project, not affiliated with Microsoft or the tree-sitter organization. Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are welcome.

## What it does

Parses Q# source files into a concrete syntax tree that editors can use for syntax highlighting, code folding, symbol navigation, and indentation.

Built by reading the [Q# language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/user-guide/) and the [Q# compiler source](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp). Tested against Q# files in the microsoft/qsharp repository.

### Supported constructs

- Namespaces, imports, exports, open directives
- Operations and functions with type parameters, functor clauses, specializations
- Structs, newtypes, all builtin types
- Full expression grammar with operator precedence per the [official specification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/user-guide/language/expressions/precedenceandassociativity)
- Quantum-specific syntax: `use`/`borrow`, `within`/`apply`, `repeat`/`until`/`fixup`, `Adjoint`/`Controlled`
- All literals: int, bigint, float, imaginary, string, interpolated string, bool, Result, Pauli
- External scanner for float/range disambiguation (`1.` vs `0..5`)

### Known limitations

- Explicit type arguments on calls (`Foo<Int>(x)`) are not supported due to `<`/`>` ambiguity with comparison operators. Q# type inference handles this in practice.
- Open-ended step ranges (`...2...`) parse but the AST does not perfectly represent all range component positions.
- This is a v0.x project. There may be edge cases that are not yet covered.
